- In a singly linked list, there are two portions of each node.
## a) The DATA - the node content itself
## b) The ADDRESS - points to the next part of the list
- A data attribute called the head points to whatever is the first item in the linked
list, where the last node in the list has a NONE pointer
- To make this happen, you are going to make a node class with attributes (DATA, NEXTNODE)
